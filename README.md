# ErrorAnalysis
An OpenSocial gadget [app](http://www.golabz.eu/apps/experimental-error-calculator) for the [go-lab](http://www.golabz.eu) platform

This tool allows students to calculate experimental errors that stem from real experimental setups. Using this tool, students may learn about the different sources of error that occur when performing experiments and about the different types of errors that can be calculated so as to decide whether an experiment is precise and accurate.
